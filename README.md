# Website Design for Boston Hotel

This was a very basic HTML and CSS webpage to practice designing the front-end of web development. Using many CSS classes, we were able to create a type of framework to keep a consistant design through out the webpages but also allow from future pages to be added. In future projects I will be creating more complex pages that will use FlexBox, CSS Grid, and SaSS.
